        <h1>Playing a song</h1>
        <h2><a name="opening_an_existing_song" id="opening_an_existing_song">Opening an existing song</a></h2>
        <p>TuxGuitar currently supports several file formats. Besides its internal <em><strong>.tg</strong></em> format (which is recommended), it can open and play all Guitar Pro formats (<strong><em>.gtp</em></strong>, <strong><em>.gp3</em></strong>, <strong><em>.gp4</em></strong>, <strong><em>.gp5</em></strong>, <strong><em>.gpx</em></strong>, <strong><em>.gp</em></strong>) and also the PowerTab format (<strong><em>.ptb</em></strong>).</p>
        <p>You can open a file through the <strong>File → Open</strong> dialog in TuxGuitar. If you installed TuxGuitar using our regular installation packages, the above file types are associated with TuxGuitar in your operating system, so you can open them directly by clicking on the file in the file manager.</p>
        <p>Another way to open a file is directly from an online resource, by using the <strong>File → Open URL</strong> dialog. If you enter the correct URL of an online file TuxGuitar can open, you can view and play the file in the same manner as if it was opened from a local folder. Of course, you cannot save the file back on the same URL, you can save it only as a local file.</p>
        <h2><a name="playback" id="playback">Playback</a></h2>
        <p>Using playback controls you can play, stop and pause the playback, but you can also navigate through the song (next/previous measure, beginning/end of a song). During the playback the currently played note will be colored in red, so it is easier to see how the current note is played.</p>
        <p><img src="images/start/tb_transport.png" /></p>
        <p>You can find the playback controls in the main toolbar and in the <strong>Player</strong> dropdown menu. There is also a dedicated player window you can access under <strong>View → Show Player</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/start/p_transport_window.png" /></p>
        <p>You can also navigate through the song using the "transporter" in the track table at the bottom of the application window, which is the graphical representation of a song’s tracks. It is automatically scrolled during the playback and using the scrollbar on the bottom of the screen you can view the whole song. You can access the wanted instrument and measure by clicking on the proper rectangle in the "transporter" widget.</p>
        <p>The current instrument can be changed by clicking on the instrument name in the track table. Display will be changed accordingly to view the wanted instrument’s notes.</p>
        <h2>Metronome</h2>
        <p>Adds an audible click to every beat to help you practice playing to a regular pulse.</p>
        <h2>Count In</h2>
        <p>Adds an audible cue at the beginning of the song to ensure a uniform entrance and to establish the song's initial tempo.</p>
        <h2><a name="play_mode" id="play_mode">Play Mode</a></h2>
        <p>There are two different ways to play a song: In "Simple Mode" or in "Training Mode".</p>
        <p><img src="images/start/p_mode.png" /></p>
        <h3><a name="play_mode_simple" id="play_mode_simple">Simple Mode</a></h3>
        <p>Simple mode allows you to set a constant playback speed. You can play and examine the song with half of the speed, 1% of the original speed or even with the up-tempo. This is achieved by changing the playback percentage to an arbitrary value (50% is half of the speed; 200% doubles the tempo).</p>
        <p>You can also select to continuously repeat the song and to only play a piece of the song (Play looped, Loop Range).</p>
        <h3><a name="play_mode_trainer" id="play_mode_trainer">Training Mode</a></h3>
        <p>Training mode gives you the opportunity to practice with a gradual tempo incrementation. You can choose to start slowly, in only half of a tempo, but in every cycle of the tune to increase the tempo by 5%, getting to the full speed after 10 playbacks. You choose a <em>beginning tempo</em>, <em>ending tempo</em> and an <em>increment</em> (in percentage) that increases the tempo after each cycle.</p>
        <h2><a name="views" id="views">Views</a></h2>
        <p>There are two types of the view: <strong>Page Layout</strong> or <strong>Linear Layout</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/start/tb_layout.png" /></p>
        <p><strong>Linear Layout</strong> displays a track in a single line. It means that on the current sheet is read in the right direction, and the time is represented by the <strong>width</strong> of current display. <strong>Page Layout</strong> displays a track as a page of a sheet - when the notes exceed width of the sheet display, they are displayed in the next line. So sheet is read in the direction from top to bottom, and time is represented by the <strong>height</strong> of the current display (in the case of single track view).</p>
        <p>By enabling <strong>Multitrack</strong> view, in the same line of a layout will be displayed all the instruments. So, if you use Linear layout and enable Multitrack view all the instruments will be one beneath each other and played in the right direction. <em>Using Multitrack view with Page layout can sometimes result in a pretty messy layout.</em></p>
        <p>By enabling the <strong>Show Score</strong> option, the scores will be displayed above the tabs.</p>
        <p>By enabling the <strong>Compact</strong> view, you can make your tablature look more compact, if you consider it too wide.</p>
        <p>You can also change the current view during playback.</p><br />
