# Contribute
This github repository was made by developers, that had seen that the project, which was originally hosted on sourceforge, was not maintained anymore. The founder of Tuxguitar had not answered any questions and his website that contains information for developers is down.

After some weeks we were able to build tuxguitar for different GUIs and now (end of 2024) we can tell how to setup a SWT project in eclipse. The information shown here possibly will change over the next month, each time when we have found out some new aspects about how to develop.

## Prerequisites

* **General**: To contribute, you need nothing more than to enjoy open-source and do the community a favor. 

* **Programmer**: As a programmer, you may be missing a function in our software yourself and would like to add it. Or you have discovered a bug and know how to fix it.

* **Writer**: It's always good to have people around who can express themselves well and are able to write easy-to-read documentation. A warm welcome.

* **Commentators**: You enjoy communicating with others. Then liven up our discussions and collect answers to frequently asked questions. Make first contact with participants of our Forums and keep them happy.

* **Backers**: A warm welcome. If you want the project to last and you are familiar with the financing of such projects, take us by the hand.

We will now focus on the **programmer** role.

## Setup Eclipse IDE
We think that most of the java developers are familiar with the Eclipse IDE, one of the most used IDEs not just for writing and testing code. It supports many processes around software projects, even writing this documentation in markdown. For information about downloading and installing it see <https://eclipse.org>.
Our examples and screenshots here are from Eclipse Version 2023-12.

### Copy your forked tuxguitar repository
Because normally you do not have the right to push to the helge17/tuxguitar repository, you must first fork the repository in order to make changes to your forked repository as a fist step. It depends on how you host your own repos to know, what steps to do. This is nothing that's in the context of this documentation. Read the docs of your repository provider.
